The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully. One common issue is the use of spaces in the expression. Consider this code: 
```css
width: calc(100% - 20px);
```
This is correct. But this is wrong:
```css
width: calc( 100% - 20px );
```
Unnecessary spaces can cause the calculation to fail. 
Another issue is related to operator precedence.  Ensure you use parenthesis to force the order of operations you intend:
```css
height: calc((100vw / 16) * 9);
/* Correct */
height: calc(100vw / 16 * 9); /* Incorrect, might not calculate as intended*/
```
Lastly, be careful about unit mismatch in `calc()` expressions. For example:
```css
width: calc(100% + 20); /* Incorrect: 20 has no unit */
width: calc(100% + 20px); /* Correct */
```
