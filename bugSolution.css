The solutions address the issues identified in `bug.css` by:
1. Removing unnecessary spaces within the `calc()` expressions
2. Adding parenthesis to ensure correct operator precedence.
3. Ensuring consistent units across the calculation.
```css
/* Correct use of calc() */
width: calc(100% - 20px);
height: calc((100vw / 16) * 9);
width: calc(100% + 20px);
```
Always double-check your `calc()` expressions for proper syntax and unit consistency to avoid unexpected issues.  Thorough testing is crucial.
